MoveCraft was originally developed by Yogoda.
Then ported to Bukkit and advanced by SycoPrime.
MoveCraft is now in the hands of Valgor.

This fork has been created as an attempt to fix up Movecraft. The code has just been maintained and with the huge changes to minecraft and bukkit since its conception and rewwrites, it is desperately in need of some love.
